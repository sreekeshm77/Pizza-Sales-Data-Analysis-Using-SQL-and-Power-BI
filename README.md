1. The project involved analyzing pizza sales data using SQL and Power BI (PBI).
2. The data was cleaned in Excel by changing data types and handling missing values.
3. The cleaned data was loaded into PBI Desktop for further analysis.
4. New columns and measures were created using DAX functions in PBI.
5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were visualized using card visuals.
6. Trends and filters were visualized with bar charts, column charts, funnel charts, and area charts.
7. A donut chart was used to indicate the percentage of pizza sales.
8. The KPIs and chart trends were cross-verified using Microsoft SQL Server.
9. SQL queries were executed to calculate KPIs like total revenue, total pizzas sold, average order time, total orders, and average pizzas per order.
10. Both the PBI dashboard and the SQL Server outputs were cross-checked and found to match.
