*Pizza Sales Data Analysis Using SQL and Power BI*

This project focuses on analyzing pizza sales data through a combination of SQL and Power BI, aiming to uncover insights that drive business decisions and enhance performance.

The analysis began with an extensive review of the pizza sales data, utilizing SQL and Power BI (PBI) to delve into various metrics that provide a comprehensive understanding of sales patterns. The first step involved data preparation, where the raw data was carefully examined and cleaned in Excel. This cleaning process included changing data types to ensure consistency and accuracy, handling missing values to maintain the integrity of the dataset, and structuring the data to be seamlessly imported into PBI Desktop for deeper analysis.

Once the data was prepared, it was loaded into Power BI Desktop, where the next phase of analysis commenced. This involved the creation of new columns and measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions in Power BI. The use of DAX functions enabled the calculation of complex metrics and the addition of new dimensions to the data, which facilitated more meaningful analysis. For instance, custom calculations were created to measure performance indicators that directly correlate with the business's goals, such as sales growth rates and customer purchasing patterns.

To visualize the key performance indicators (KPIs), various Power BI tools were employed. Card visuals were used to display KPIs like total revenue, total orders, and average pizzas sold per order in a clear and concise manner. These visuals provided an at-a-glance summary of critical metrics, enabling quick assessments of business performance. To further explore trends and sales behaviors, a range of visualization types were utilized, including bar charts, column charts, funnel charts, and area charts. These helped illustrate different aspects of the data, such as monthly sales trends, seasonal sales patterns, and customer preferences.

A donut chart was specifically used to indicate the percentage of pizza sales, breaking down the overall sales into easily digestible segments. This visual helped highlight the most popular pizza types and customer choices, which are crucial for understanding market demand and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.

To ensure accuracy and reliability, the KPIs and visual trends generated in Power BI were cross-verified using Microsoft SQL Server. This step involved running SQL queries to calculate key metrics such as total revenue, total pizzas sold, average order time, total orders, and average pizzas per order. By executing these SQL queries, the results obtained were directly compared to those visualized in Power BI, providing a robust validation of the data integrity and analysis methods used.

Finally, the cross-verification process between the Power BI dashboard outputs and the SQL Server query results confirmed consistency and accuracy in the data analysis. This alignment ensured that the insights drawn from the Power BI dashboard were reliable and actionable, supporting strategic decision-making to enhance business performance.

Overall, this project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to data analysis using SQL and Power BI, showcasing the effective use of data cleaning, advanced functions, visualization techniques, and cross-verification to derive valuable business insights.
